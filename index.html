		<h3>The point, rasion, zweck, what have you</h3>
		<p>
			This website is a simple project to practice my HTML skills. I have built
			no wireframe and will design this as I go. I'm not aestheically inclined
			as it is and add to that a lack of any CSS skills, well, it is not a huge
			leap to figure out this is going to be a spartan effort. And that's
			probably an insult to spartan efforts.
		</p>
		<p>
			I thought it easiest to focus on websites I read and try to create some
			rationale for including form tags. I make no apologies for any resulting
			incoherence because cohesion isn't the point.
